# Overview
This is the Lua Bytecode Interpreter by [Rerumu](https://www.roblox.com/users/70540486/profile) (mostly a rework from the one a couple others made).

The rework doesn't contain anything really new but mostly a different approach on some operations and a lot of performance improvements.
Special thanks to [cntkillme](https://www.roblox.com/users/294568/profile) for the gBits simple implementation.

To-do list and details in the Source file.

I'll be working out most if not all the to-dos whenever I get around to working more on this.
