# Overview
This is the Lua Bytecode Interpreter by [Rerumu](https://www.roblox.com/users/70540486/profile) (mostly a rework from the one a couple others made).

The rework doesn't contain anything really new but mostly a different approach on some operations and a lot of performance improvements.
Special thanks to [cntkillme](https://www.roblox.com/users/294568/profile) for the gBits simple implementation.

To-do list and details in the Source file.

I'll be working out most if not all the to-dos whenever I get around to working more on this.

Last update, the following issues were solved:
* https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/issues/9
* https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/issues/8
* https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/issues/6
* https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/issues/5
* https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/issues/4

And a couple better algos implemented, along with the removal of the in-script changes.
Shout-out to Eternal for sniffing out the bugs for me.
